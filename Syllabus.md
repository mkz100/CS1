* Recorded video #1 ~ #10 will be delivered on BaiDu Cloud class web site. 
* Projects and Term Paper will be done in groups of 3-4 students.
* Everyone is expected to take part in Term Paper Presentation.

## Grading
* Projects: 80% ( 20% for each project )  
* Term Paper Presentation: 20%
* Group projects and term paper are expected to be done by the groups individually. Not shared across the groups. Each group member is expected to contribute. Especially the term paper is expected to be presented together with everyone participating. You won't receive the corresponding grade if you do not participate.

| A | B | C | D  | F  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| >=90 | >=80 | >=70 | >=60 | <60

## Class Philosophy
It is my fault if you could not learn in the class. So please do ask questions if you have any. Doing projects are one of the best way to learn. So find your partners for the group projects, get your hands dirty and ready to code and have fun.

## Academic Honesty
Reiterate: Group projects and term paper are expected to be done by the groups individually. Not shared across the groups. Each group member is expected to contribute. Especially the term paper is expected to be presented together with everyone participating. You won't receive the corresponding grade if you do not participate.
